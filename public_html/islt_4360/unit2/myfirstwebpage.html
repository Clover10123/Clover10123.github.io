<body><p>Hello, Class! My name is Krista. This is block is surrounded by paragraph tags. Paragraphs are a block level element. </p>

<p>However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new block of text, but they state that there is a meaning change. For example,
     <b>this text is emphasized by making it bold</b>. 
     Sometimes we may choose to emphasize other text by <i>italicizing it</i> or <u>underlining it</u>.</p>
  <p><h2>My Lists. This is an H2 header; I'm honestly not sure if you want this word for word.</h2></p>
  <p><h3>Unordered lists.</h3></p>
<p><ul>We can also make lists. Here are a list of things that are pretty okay.<p><li>The color blue</li><li>The movie <i>The Shining</i></li>
  <li>Dry cereal</li></p></ul></p><p>
<h3>Ordered lists.</h3><p></p>
<ol>Here is an ordered list of things that are pretty great.<p></p>
  <li><i>Doctor Who</i></li>
  <li>Boyfriends that cook</li>
  <li>Learning new things</li></ol><p>
    Links.</p>
<p>I can also link to different things. For example, I can go to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a> by going to <a href="https://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> This is an absolute link because it has the entire URL listed there. If I were to link to something locally on my server relative to this file, it would be a relative link. </p>
<p><h2>Inline styling with colors</h2></p>
I can also color text using inline styling, but for the most part it is really best to use styling that is done in the header or using a stylesheet. Here are some <font color=#008000>green</font> words. <font color=#cc0000>And some red.</font> <font color=#0000b3>And some blue.</font> It is really easy to look for colors. Just google it, honestly.
