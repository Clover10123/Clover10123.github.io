<h1>Participants </h1><br>

 Alek Willsey is my boyfriend, and he evaluated my page as a user tester. He is a graduate student in the philosophy department at 
  Mizzou working towards a Ph.D. He is on his second year through graduate school. Typically, Alek uses mac products, but he used my
  PC to view my web page. I use an HP envy and I use Google Chrome as my browser. I encouraged Alek to explore the site at his own 
  will, hoping he would find my website informative without any guidance.<br>
  
  <h2>Summary of Evaluation comments</h2><br>
  
  Average scores from the evaluators: <br>
  Design: 44/45<br>
  Content: 32/35<br>
  Credibility: 25/30 <br>
  
  
  All of my evaluators thought the about page was a bit vague. Story is engaging and encourages them to wonder what the gameplay will be like
  once it's uploaded to the website.
  
  Based on the feedback I recieved, I propose making the following changes:<br>
  
  <ul>
    <p>Design</p>
    <li> I will fix the black text at the bottom so it can be read.
    I will also change the "about" to mean something more interesting. The help page has a box that goes off the screen, so I 
    will fix that, too.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul> 
    <p>Content</p>
    <li> I have to upload the game, for one. I can also add more personal details in the about page to establish more credibility.
    Help could also feature more contact information.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <p>Credibility</p>
    <li> It's all creative work, so not much to do here other than alter the about page to mention more of me or my affiliates.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <p> Code </p>
    <li> Most of the code problems rest with design.</li>
  </ul>
