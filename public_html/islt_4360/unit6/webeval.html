<h1>Participants </h1><br>

 Alek Willsey is my boyfriend, and he evaluated my page as a user tester. He is a graduate student in the philosophy department at 
  Mizzou working towards a Ph.D. He is on his second year through graduate school. Typically, Alek uses mac products, but he used my
  PC to view my web page. I use an HP envy and I use Google Chrome as my browser. I encouraged Alek to explore the site at his own 
  will, hoping he would find my website informative without any guidance.<br>
