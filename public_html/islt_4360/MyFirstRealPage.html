    <h3>This is my first proper website for this class. It won't be my first
    ever website, but practice never hurts. </h3><br>
    <h2>Topic 1</h2><br>
    <h3>Video Game Websites</h3>
    <p> My first idea for my website is to create space for my video game. An excellent example of this very idea is <a href="http://www.blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/">Town of Salem</a>.
    </p>
    <p> I would like to introduce the power of HTML and Javascript in digital art through the form of video games.
    I intend to do this in two ways.</p><ol>
    <li> Allow access to the games script content on the main page.</li>
    <li> Allow access to the game's statistics and other features that accompany the game.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Topic 2</h2>
    <h3>Digital Art Theory and History</h3>
    <p> If my first idea fails, the my next idea for a website is to create one that contains insightful information on why digital art is important.<p>
    <p>As Extra Credits says, <blockquote> Stuff about video games.</blockquote></p>
