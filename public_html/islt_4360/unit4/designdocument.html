	The purpose of my website is to provide game entertainment and display creative digital media art. My goal is to display my video game in a way that makes the most meaningful experience. People love games and love entertainment, especially in this time of political turmoil, and this website will provide this. Entertainment is a means for people to express their beliefs and needs and also a way to bring joy to others.
<br>
	I spoke to about seven people, all with varying levels of internet and computer skill, all with varying degrees of dedication to gaming. Each one of them said they turned to video games to get their mind off of things, but still crave mental stimulation. A game that provides a mental challenge without lacking the entertainment is exactly what this game wishes to achieve. 
<br>
    These were my questions (along with the summary of the answers, as there were many of them):<br>
How often do you play mobile or social games?<br>
<br>
Lowest was 4 days a week, most was 3-4 hours a day.
<br>
What is the thing that keeps bringing you back to your current favorite video game?<br>
Favorite: Strategy elements, entertainment
<br>
What about card games do you like to see and what frustrates you?
<br>
Things liked include: Challenge, new cards, change, instant gratification
<br>
This disliked include: Power curve, unreasonable rules, complicated changes, unbalanced power
</p>
<p>
Why do you play games?<br>
(Responder 1): I see games as a way to interact with a story. I am a storyteller, always have been. I love to read and watch films. I love to see what characters do... but in all other forms of stories you have to watch the character you follow do a set sequence of events. You know the runtime of the film; you know the pages left in the story; nothing you do will change the events of the character. You just merely experience it... in a game you get to make choices…. (Some of the others:) I play game for pure enjoyment!

	My website is designed for an audience between the ages of 13-40, for any gender, but slightly directed towards males. Anyone in North America, Europe, and Australia would appreciate my website. Any person who enjoys activities that require strategy and entertainment, such as chess, card games, or board games would appreciate this website. Anyone who has used the internet or computers at least a little bit can also appreciate this website because of its intuitive, simple design.

	The content of this website is a game/series of games (for now, just one game.) It will also contain information about the lore of the game. The main page will have the game. Any extra info will be on side panels.
</p>
<p>
	Everything item on the website is within two clicks away from the main page. Help is also found on the main page, and the main attraction is front and center, on the very first page of the website. My target audience will immediately receive exactly what they came for, and especially since the target audience is mostly younger people, the may have shorter attention spans. The easier I make the website, the better. Since the primary goal of the site is to entertain, I don’t need my audience getting bored with reading large amounts of text. There will be plenty of colors and pictures, along with large text with word restrictions on every paragraph. The background will be dark and plain, so as to not distract from the main attractions of the page.
