  <h1>5 Major Ethical Theories</h1>
  <h2>Summaries</h2>
  <div><br>
<ul>
  <li>Kantianism</li>
  Kantianism is the theory that consideres the wrongness of an action in a rules-based approach. The categorical imperative,
  which is given to us by reason alone, can be formulated in various ways, but ultimately determines what is morally 
  permissible. The Categorical Imperative is an unconditional moral obligation that is binding in all circumstances, regardless of
  consequences.
  What is "wrong" is based on reasoning alone.
  
  <li>Care Ethics</li>
  Care Ethics implies that there is moral significance in the fundamental elements of relationships and 
  dependencies in human life.
  
  <li>Utilitarianism</li>
  Utilitarianism is the theory that states that an action is right insofar as it maximizes general utility, which is usually
  identified as happiness. 
  
  <li>Virtue Ethics</li>
  Based on Aristotle's writings, Virtue Ethics attempts to discover and classify what might be deemed of moral character, 
  and to apply the moral character as a base for one's choices and actions.
  
  <li>Divine Command Theory</li>
  Divine Command Theory is the view that morality is dependent upon a higher power, and that moral obligation 
  consists in obedience to its commands (I.e. absolute obedience to God or Allah).
