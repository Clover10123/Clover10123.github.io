  <h2>Creation Story</h2>
  <div><p>Dream Universe Creation story<br>


Once upon a time, there was nothing except two entities. These entities were called chaos and order. Though they were both all-knowing entities, they quarrelled over the best use of their power. 
    Order believed that everything had a proper place and structure, and that there should be rules to all things. 
    Chaos believed differently-- Chaos believed that all things pull away from structure and their natural state was to be apart from rules or purpose. 
    Between the two of these entities rested a great power source once known as the crypt. 
    Inside this crypt were the greatest powers that could ever exist. 
    Both order and chaos equally had knowledge and power to control these powerful elements, but because they quarrelled over its proper usage, it was never opened-- until chaos decided to start a war. 
    Chaos opened the crypt and unleashed the powers, causing thousands of explosions to occur over and over and over again, 
    sending ripples of power throughout reality. The power expanded and grew and died, spreading until time and space took up a great space within the nothingness. 
    Order was furious, but saw it wrong to destroy what was created, so order began to control the power by giving it rules and structure. 
    Planets began to form and life began to grow. Galaxies and stars began to burn and rotate around each other. 
    Chaos, however, did not like this order, and sought to destroy it. 
    Chaos created black holes to eat the stars, death to end life, and cursed the universe with mortality, that all things with life energy would expire. 
    Order retaliated by turning this destruction into part of the great system, 
    by using death to perpetuate life, but Chaos then created death energy by turning the dead into the undead, forever incapable of perpetuating the life cycle. 
    This battle continued until the Order began to saw that the universe produced beautiful life. 
    This life was intelligent and precious, and knew if the war between Order and Chaos were to continue, eventually the precious life would die. 
    Order instead decided to challenge Chaos to a game. Order said, “If what you say is true of reality, that all is meant to be in chaos, 
    then prove it through the life you have created. If instead, I am right, naturally, the life will choose order. 
    I propose this game: Give the power to the life of the universe, then grant them the awareness and power to wield it as they desire. 
    At the end of days, it will be decided who among us is most fit to rule.” 
    
    And thus it was born: The twelve Guardians, those who would recieve the greatest powers of the universe and could control every instance
    of its existence.
    
    The generation of Guardians had passed where a human from Earth was chosen.
    
    Her guardian companions came to be as follows:
    <b>
