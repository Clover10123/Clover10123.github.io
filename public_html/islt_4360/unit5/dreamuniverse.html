  <h2>Creation Story</h2>
  <div><p>Dream Universe Creation story<br>


Once upon a time, there was nothing except two entities. These entities were called chaos and order. Though they were both all-knowing entities, they quarrelled over the best use of their power.<br> 
    Order believed that everything had a proper place and structure, and that there should be rules to all things. <br>
    Chaos believed differently-- Chaos believed that all things pull away from structure and their natural state was to be apart from rules or purpose. <br>
    Between the two of these entities rested a great power source once known as the crypt. <br>
    Inside this crypt were the greatest powers that could ever exist. <br>
    Both order and chaos equally had knowledge and power to control these powerful elements, but because they quarrelled over its proper usage, it was never opened-- until chaos decided to start a war. <br>
    Chaos opened the crypt and unleashed the powers, causing thousands of explosions to occur over and over and over again, <br>
    sending ripples of power throughout reality. The power expanded and grew and died, spreading until time and space took up a great space within the nothingness. <br>
    Order was furious, but saw it wrong to destroy what was created, so order began to control the power by giving it rules and structure. <br>
    Planets began to form and life began to grow. Galaxies and stars began to burn and rotate around each other. <br>
    Chaos, however, did not like this order, and sought to destroy it. <br>
    Chaos created black holes to eat the stars, death to end life, and cursed the universe with mortality, that all things with life energy would expire. <br>
    Order retaliated by turning this destruction into part of the great system, <br>
    by using death to perpetuate life, but Chaos then created death energy by turning the dead into the undead, forever incapable of perpetuating the life cycle. <br>
    This battle continued until the Order began to saw that the universe produced beautiful life. <br>
    This life was intelligent and precious, and knew if the war between Order and Chaos were to continue, eventually the precious life would die. <br>
    Order instead decided to challenge Chaos to a game. Order said, “If what you say is true of reality, that all is meant to be in chaos, <br>
    then prove it through the life you have created. If instead, I am right, naturally, the life will choose order. <br>
    I propose this game: Give the power to the life of the universe, then grant them the awareness and power to wield it as they desire. <br>
    At the end of days, it will be decided who among us is most fit to rule.” <br>
    
    And thus it was born: The twelve Guardians, those who would recieve the greatest powers of the universe and could control every instance
    of its existence. <br>
    
    The generation of Guardians had passed where a human from Earth was chosen. <br>
    
    Her guardian companions came to be as follows:<br>
    <b>
      Princess Sun, Guardian of Sun, from Planet Earth. Human.<br>
