    <h1>Digital Art For The Future</h1><br>
    <h2>This is my first proper website for this class. It won't be my first
    ever website, but practice never hurts. </h2><br>
    <h2>Topic 1</h2><br>
    <h3>Video Game Websites</h3>
    <p> My first idea for my website is to create space for my video game. An excellent example of this very idea is <a href="http://www.blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/">Town of Salem</a>.
    </p>
    <p> I would like to introduce the power of HTML and Javascript in digital art through the form of video games.
    I intend to do this in two ways.</p><ol>
    <li> Allow access to the games script content on the main page.</li>
    <li> Allow access to the game's statistics and other features that accompany the game.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Topic 2</h2>
    <h3>Digital Art Theory and History</h3>
    <p> If my first idea fails, the my next idea for a website is to create one that contains insightful information on why digital art is important.</p>
    <br>As Zhenghua Yang shares with Extra Credits, <blockquote> Video games are no longer toys for kids, and we must begin treating them with a practical perspective. Video games can teach practical skills. They can advance science. They can heal trauma and solve conflicts. Two gamers can play side by side virtually in a game of League of Legends working together to achieve a common goal. They don't need to share the same language, the same culture, even the same world beliefs. It doesn't matter if they're American, Chinese, Israeli or Palestinian, our next Nobel Peace Prize winners are no longer just going to be the influential artists or policy generators. Maybe instead, it'll be the kid who's in a garage right now creating the next big game that brings the world together through play. </blockquote>
