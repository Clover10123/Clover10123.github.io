<h1>My Vertical Dropdown Menu Example</h1>
<p>Please read through this explanation I've cleverly inserted into these menus. </p>

<ul id="nav">

	<li><a href="#">Item 1</a>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#">I took this class to learn the coding skills required to produce games.</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">In other classes, I had a few roadblocks, though.</a>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#">The classes in the CS department didn't really work for me.</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">I wanted a class which catered to my preferred speed of learning.</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">I hate lecture halls.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><a href="#">Taking this class really was just a formality.</a>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#">I'd already taken several independent Javascript courses.</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">Much of the information in this class was stuff I already knew.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><a href="#">I didn't just want to learn the basics.</a>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#">I feel like I've learned about loops over and over again.</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">Learning the "what" isn't always as valuable as learning how to use it.</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">But no class really focused on that.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="#">But that's obviously easier said than done.</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Taking coding classes is like being handed a box of tools.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">The teacher says "this is a hammer. You hit things with it, usually nails."</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Student says, "okay, I understand how to use this hammer."</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="#">When you try to bring skills to the project...</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">The teacher might say, "okay, now build a house!"</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">The student will respond, "What? I don't know how to do that. I only know how to use this hammer."</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">I often feel like that student.</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="#">Most programmers or programming students seem to do better.</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Probably because over the course of many programming classes, they've had enough experience "building houses," so to speak.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">But I'm so close to graduating, and I have so many of the skills required to pursue my career of choice.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">I simply don't have the time to take a plethora of programming and development classes just to accomplish this.</a></li>

				</ul>
			</li>

		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><a href="#">Item 2</a>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#">Solutions</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">So, what would be handy for a person like me...</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Is a class that simply teaches how to take what you know, like if and while loops and such,</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">And to use those "tools" to put together a program. Something workable and usable. </a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="#">Resources</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">If such a class exists, I would be willing to take it.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">But if not, I suppose I could always stick to the ol' trial and error.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Or just do what everyone else does and pay someone else to do it.</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="#">I don't like that idea, though. That's lazy and expensive.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">I'd rather at least have enough coding knowledge to produce a basic game.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#">If only I could hire a tutor or something which moves at my preferred pace.</a></li>

		</ul>
