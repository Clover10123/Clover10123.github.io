<p> Uh, I think this meets the requirements of the assignment according to the website. I could be wrong though. But anyway, I hope you
  understand, and again, I apologize for not working as hard on these assignments as I should be. Plausibly, I could still pass with a B- 
  as long as I get good scores on the next coming assignments. That really shouldn't be hard. I appreciate this class and the feedback
  you provide with each assignment. Not many professors go out of their way to be so interactive with their students. I look forward
  to watching the feedback video. Sincerely, Clover </p>
