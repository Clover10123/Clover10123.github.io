Clover Ross is my name, and I am a digital storyteller who 

utilizes web programming, animation, and videography in my 

art works. My projects highlight the importance of morality, 

the relevance of philosophy, and the impact of cultural 

appropriation. By exploring these concepts through interactive 

gameplay, I invite the audience to physically and 

independently explore topics. Many of my projects are also 

based in <a href="https://0xytoxinblog.wordpress.com/">fantasy imaginary worlds</a> which she created. I am 

currently employed as a game designer for the SISLT 

department, with the MHS program. <br>

While still attending the University of Missouri, I have been 

working on game projects independently, as well as many of 

my own animated film projects. I also create illustrations that 

reflect my thoughts and the lore of her fantasy world. I have 

taken the ISLT 4360 class that preceded this one, (in fact, I 

just recycled the github from that class to use for this one), 

and have taught myself the beginning of a number of different 

languages. I hope to become more proficient with this, so 

much that I can make any website with confidence.
