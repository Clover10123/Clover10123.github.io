  <div> <p id="emphasis" class="heading">December 10th, 2017: Two new games arriving on Clover's Magical Land of Fun Time!</p><br>
    <p id="emphasis"> New Society and The Ethics Game.<br>
    New Society, a game still under development, is now available for play testing under the Games tab. This world was once a thriving
    society, but society has been destroyed by a zombie threat! Many years have passed, and humanity is ready to rebuild life as they
    once knew it, and they have entrusted you with the power and responsibility of bringing their civilization back to normal. Collect 
    resources, expand your population, and manage all the politics that come with restoring society.</p><br>
    
   <p> Coming soon is The Ethics Game, an award-winning story driven game which follows Emeka on her journey through campus during a robot attack crisis.
    In the distant future, students at Mizzou have come to depend on intelligent droids for many different types of tasks-- from changing
    car oil to helping us cross the street. One day, the engineers installed IRIS, a mainframe operating system which enables the computer to
    comprehend higher thoughts, including morality. With this new update, the droids suddenly began attacking humans! Emeka must protect
    the two children she babysits as they journey across campus, meeting new survivors but also encountering difficult situations which press
    her ability to make morally right decisions. Will your personal ethical code successfully guide you into making the right choice,
    or will your intuitions fail you? Help Emeka make the right decision in The Ethics Game. </p>
    
    Disclaimer: The Ethics Game is currently in prototype phase.
