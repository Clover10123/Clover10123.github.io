<div id="ajaxContent"> Thank you.
  I realize that through the course, I haven't been putting in much effort. For this, I apologize. The other classes I'm currently taking
  are much greater in difficulty, and this class ended up sliding to the back of my priority list. The class is excellent, though, for what
  it's worth. I think it provides space to learn web development that I often complain other classes lack. That being said, I hope you
  take the time to read and understand my perspective. And, well, since you have to grade this, I figure this is a fitting way to 
  accomplish this. I'm a fan of artistic gestures.
