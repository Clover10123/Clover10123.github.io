       <h3> Albert Einstein once said,</h3>
       <p> “The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead —his eyes are closed.”</p>


        I hold this belief to be true in all of my art, and hope to convey it through all of my works.

            Clover Ross is a digital storyteller pursuing a graduate certificate in digital humanities at the School of Information Science and Learning Technology at the University of Missouri. 
            Over the summer of 2018, she has been working on independent game projects which incorporate strategy, ethical thinking, and aesthetic philosophy. 
            Her most recent work, The Ethics Game (prototype), earned a 2nd place Peoples’ Choice Award in a competition through the University of Missouri. 
            She earned her B.A. in Digital Storytelling in May 2018. 
            When she was in high school, she was a Soprano II section leader in the school’s large ensemble choir, a member of South Boulevard Singers (which is an exclusive high school small ensemble choir), and a participant in State Solo & Small Ensemble festivals for vocal performers. 
            In high school, she earned I ratings in both her small ensembles at competition. 
            Despite success with her music and theater experiences in high school, she preferred to focus her skills on digital media, specifically video games. 
            Clover has developed a broad set of skills, including the following: music composition, digital art, story writing, animation, video production, programming, and sound design. 
            Though skilled in many aspects, her strength is in design theory. 
            Her deep passion for excellent video game design led her to major in Digital Storytelling when she entered Mizzou, enabling her to gain a vast amount of skills in a short amount of time by learning from critically acclaimed animators and filmmakers. 
            The School of Information Science and Learning Technology will allow her to continue exploring game design theory as well as pursue local resources in developing video games that demonstrate to “non-gamers” the importance and relevance of them in academia. 
            She aspires to lead a revolution in the video game industry by ambitiously challenging old and antiquated beliefs about what makes a video game “good,” what is defined as “art,” and why video game literacy should be the new academic pursuit. 
            When she isn’t spending over 12 hours a day creating art or programming her next project, she is actively engaged in independent game developing interest groups, both locally and nationally, 
            and aspires to be an advocate for small independent game designers.

            My vision for my video games is to educate users of all ages on elements of philosophy, psychology, and culture through an interactive experience. 
            By allowing players to explore these concepts in an interactive world, no longer does games portray what to feel– instead it allows players to come to their own conclusions about what decisions they made and why. 
            My works are based on major ethical theories, psycho-social theories, and personal experiences.
